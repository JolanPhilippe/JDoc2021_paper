From our experiment, we observe two main points. First, using a distributed strategy generally 
look too expensive for too small data set (4 first datasets). The second observation is, 
the input data and its topology has an impact on the performances. For instance, the !Pregel!
strategy looks to have a good impact on performances for the 8th dataset, where it has a bad 
impact for the 6th dataset. The fact that the experiments have been conducted on a single machine 
can be discussed. Since Spark, the used platform is designed for Cloud architectures, we have
to conduct similar experiments on a such environment.
