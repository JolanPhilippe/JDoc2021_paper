The low-code abstraction reduces the conception phase of applications. Because of the
increasing size of data, abstracting computations raised new challenges. To tackle
scalability issues raised by the size of the data, some tools are  built upon specific
computational strategies exploiting parallelism. However finding the most adapted
approach for optimizing the interactivity of the applications is not a trivial problem.
Besides, the most efficient solutions may be obtained by the use of several strategies
at the same time. This paper motivates the need for a multi-strategy use by executing
the same query using different strategies, on different input. It shows a difference 
of performances, depending on two factors: the input model, and the used strategy.
